lingering things left in nso-reverse2:

* allow usernsid to be specified via cli?

* finish and make a tutorial on the sans command
* tackle the rest of the todos
	* handle more errors where necessary
* rename poly.js to index.js and make it the entrypoint of the package so it is clearer where THE CODE IS!
* make httpolyglot do a straight through non-decrypting TLS proxy if the SNI matches something that doesn't uhhhhh UHHHHH?
	* better patches for httpolyglot in general lol? just implement the CONNECT functionality from within.
	
* CLEANUP AND SIMPLIFICATION....
* write readme, potentially rename project
* include original nso-reverse project within
* 

consider rewriting splatnet-kindle:
* in node, and it fetches gamewebtoken pre (or asynchronously with) web app (onGameWebTokenReceive).
* it will actually be able to either request the internal nso-reverse2 server OR request nxapi directly..!!!
