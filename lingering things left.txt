lingering things left in nso-reverse2:

* allow usernsid to be specified via cli?


* implement command line arguments... (loaded by index.js???)
* let you specify which certs to load, but ALSO a cli mode that will use services array to 
* tackle the rest of the todos
	* handle more errors where necessary

consider rewriting splatnet-kindle:
* in node, and it fetches gamewebtoken pre (or asynchronously with) web app (onGameWebTokenReceive).
* it will actually be able to either request the internal nso-reverse2 server OR request nxapi directly..!!!
