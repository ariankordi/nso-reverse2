lingering things left in nso-reverse2:

* finish and make a tutorial on the sans command
	* detect if nintendo-net.key, nintendo-net.pem fail to be detected
	* make it run openssl by itself!!!!!! perhaps detect mitmproxy CA
* tackle the rest of the todos, mostly HANDLING MORE ERRORS, where necessary
* rename poly.js to index.js and make it the entrypoint of the package so it is clearer where THE CODE IS!

* make httpolyglot do a straight through non-decrypting TLS proxy if the SNI matches something that doesn't uhhhhh UHHHHH?


* CLEANUP AND SIMPLIFICATION....
	* break up large functions
	* ... use linter to see cyclomatic compexity
* write readme, potentially rename project
* include original nso-reverse project within
* 

consider rewriting splatnet-kindle:
* in node, and it fetches gamewebtoken pre (or asynchronously with) web app (onGameWebTokenReceive).
* it will actually be able to either request the internal nso-reverse2 server OR request nxapi directly..!!!
